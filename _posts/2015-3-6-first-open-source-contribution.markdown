Pretty happy with myself as I just finished making my first open source contribution ever! Reddit is a website that I frequent a lot, and [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) makes Reddit so much more convenient to use, so I thought it would be really cool to contribute to something that I, myself, am using.

The problem in this situation was that user account ages were being calculated incorrectly. A user who registered on the site on February 21st, 2015 was shown to have an account age of 16 days when viewed on March 3rd, 2015. The correct age---not including the end date---is 13 days.
