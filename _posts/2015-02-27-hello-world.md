Without further ado, I present—*drumroll*—my personal website! First off, credit goes to one of my close friends, Gabe Ruiz, who convinced me to build my site from scratch (well almost) instead of using Bootstrap or finding a premade template—which was admittedly really tempting at first because there are so many good looking templates out there. But after all this work, I realized there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of knowing that all the things displayed on this webpage is your code: every div, every block of text, every heading etc.

Sadly, I can't brag that my site is completely built from scratch. I used the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) parsing engine because I really wanted to include a blog on my website, and Jekyll offered really easy and convenient manage of blog posts. Without Jekyll, I'd either have to write my own framework or manually update the HTML of the page whenever I wanted to add another blog entry, which seemed like a hassle.

On the bright side, it's been quite an educational jourey to get here. After finishing this site, I can confidentally say I have a working knowledge of Jekyll! I'm also a lot more familiar with my HTML tags and CSS selectors compared to when I just started, when I literally had to google 80% of the tags/selectors.

In the future, I'm going to use this blog for tech related content: cool new things I learned about programming languages or frameworks, frustrating bugs that I had to debug, or even random tidbits of facts regarding technology.
