    Hi I'm Yangzi, a third year Computer Science major studying at UC Berkeley. In case you're wondering how to pronounce my name, it sounds exactly like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze">the river</a>. And for the record—the river was named after <em>me</em>, not the other way around. Just don't go around telling anyone else that; wouldn't want to scare them or anything, you know.

    Academically, my favorite CS class was Algorithms; I really like the amount of creative thinking involved in devising an algorithm for seemingly difficult problems. The "AHA!" moment after struggling with a problem for hours was just so rewarding. I can confidently say every time I did a homework assignment, I came out of it feeling like my IQ had increased.

    Outside of classwork, I like to do web and iOS development. I still have tons to learn about both, but I'm trying to learn as quickly and as best as I can while still in school. Check out some of <a href="theyangziriver.com/projects/">my most recent projects</a>!

    Besides programming, I'm very passionate about hip hop dance. When I hear music with a sick beat or nice melody, my body just naturally wants to move. I can be spotted walking to and from class waving my arms strangely, but people don't realize that I'm just freestyling! I also like working out/exercising because they put me in a lot of situations in which I push my phyiscal and mental limits.
